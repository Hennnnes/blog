> The reason we don’t get too formal about diagramming is because they’re often not close enough to reality. You can draw and draw, but the reality is until you start writing some code or implementing a design, you don’t know what you’re going to hit. Maybe you’ll hit a technical limitation or maybe something just flat out doesn’t work. All the diagrams in the world don’t get you closer to finding out that stuff. So the sooner you get to real code, the sooner you‘ll get to seeing what’s possible. Fast and iterative in real code is where you want to be, not locked into a document.
