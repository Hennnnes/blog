Ich bin in einem Newsletter auf einen [Artikel](https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/) aufmerksam geworden.
Einige spannende Gedanken habe ich rausgeschrieben.

> “Where is the good knife?” If you’re looking for your good X, you have bad Xs. Throw those out. 

> You can automate mundane computer tasks with Autohotkey (or AppleScript). If you keep doing a sequence “so simple a computer can do it”, make the computer do it. 

> Reward yourself after completing challenges, even badly. 

> Exercise is the most important lifestyle intervention you can do. Even the bare minimum (15 minutes a week) has a huge impact. Start small. 

> Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation. 

> Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to. 

> How you spend every day is how you spend your life. 

> Things that aren’t your fault can still be your responsibility. 

> In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people. Resist these. 

> Human mood and well-being are heavily influenced by simple things: Exercise, good sleep, light, being in nature. It’s cheap to experiment with these.

> There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out.
